#Fetcn & Merge vs Pull
#git fetch gathers any info/commits from the target branch that do not exist in the current branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current branch. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your current branch, you must use git merge afterwards.
git fetch
git merge origin

#edit Fred.txt

#selects all files that have changed and made a commit
git commit -a -m "Seventh Commit: Edited Fred"
git status
#optional
git reflog

#can change Fred again
git add fred.txt
git commit -m "Seventh Commit: JK Test"
git push origin


#Note
#Git clone is done just once
#Git add -> Git commit -> Git push
#Git commit -a -> git push (shortcut)
